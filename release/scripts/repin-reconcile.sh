# Reconcile the marketplace manifest toward what the plugin repositories have
# actually released.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The release chain used to be a sequence of events — merge fires tag, tag fires
# publish, publish fires announce — and event chains cannot be safely re-run. So
# the repos grew defences against retrying instead of making retries harmless
# ("the chain does NOT self-retry past tag creation by design"), and the one step
# no event could perform, updating this manifest, was left to a human following
# docs/release/plugin-release-recipe.md by hand. Miss it and the release ships
# undistributed.
#
# This script is the opposite shape. It observes two facts — what the plugin has
# released, and what this manifest says — and emits the difference. It performs
# no step "next"; it has no notion of where in a sequence it is. Running it twice
# changes nothing the second time, which is what makes it safe to run on a timer,
# after a failure, or halfway through a botched release.
#
# Cards may be per-plugin url entries or git-subdir entries in the shared
# repository. Each shape selects only its own prefix: v or <name>--v.
#
# CREDENTIAL POSTURE
#
# It runs INSIDE hov-marketplace, so the only write is local: a branch and a PR
# in this repository. Reads are public release metadata. That inversion is the
# point — writing this manifest from a plugin repo would need a standing
# cross-repo credential, the one whose compromise reaches every installed client,
# which is exactly why the repin was manual in the first place. This script only
# edits the working tree; the workflow opens the PR, and release/scripts/repin-land.sh
# queues it for auto-merge behind the same required checks a human merge needed.
#
# Usage:
#   release/scripts/repin-reconcile.sh            # report drift, write PLAN_FILE
#   DRY_RUN=1 release/scripts/repin-reconcile.sh  # report only, never write the manifest
#
# Env:
#   MANIFEST     path to marketplace.json (default: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
#   PLAN_FILE    where to write the TSV plan (default: repin-plan.tsv)
#   ONLY_PLUGIN  restrict to one plugin name (testing / targeted repin)
#   GH_TOKEN     used by gh for release reads
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  manifest already matches every plugin's newest release, or a plan was written
#   1  a read or parse failure — NEVER interpreted as "nothing to do"
