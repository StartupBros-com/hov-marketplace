# Latest-stable guard for the reusable Tool Drop announce workflow
# (.github/workflows/hov-tool-drop-announce.yml, step "Resolve latest stable
# release"). It answers one question for the release that fired the event:
# which stable release is the newest one in this release's tag family?
#
# A shared repository holds many plugins, each releasing on <name>--v<version>
# tags, so the repository-wide "latest" release says nothing about any one
# plugin. This guard lists every release (paginated), keeps the published,
# non-draft, non-prerelease ones whose tag shares the current tag's family
# under the announce helper's rule (split on the LAST "--v"; a plain
# v<digit...> tag has the empty family; any other tag belongs to no family
# and is ignored), and orders them by numeric major.minor.patch, never by
# creation or publication time.
#
# Environment: REPOSITORY (GitHub repository name, for the marker), RELEASE_ID,
# RELEASE_TAG, GITHUB_REPOSITORY (owner/name, the API path), GITHUB_OUTPUT, and
# GH_TOKEN for gh. Output: `id=<release id>` of the family's newest stable
# release, appended to GITHUB_OUTPUT. When that is not RELEASE_ID the guard
# prints the helper's not-announced marker and exits 0; the announce helper
# then no-ops on LATEST_STABLE_ID. Malformed data fails: a stable same-family
# release whose version does not parse could otherwise make an older release
# look current and announce the wrong artifact.
